		change player side on player init
		
2 - a dynamic Loadout feature (dynLoadout) to change units loadout on player init
	  	need a list of roles (hq, sl, tl, medic, etc...)
	  	foreach roles each mod append things into each slot, so needed slots :

	  		sideArm, sideArmSupressor, sideArmOptic, weapon, weaponSupressor, weaponOptic, weaponHandle, weaponAcc
	  		comm, terminal, bino, nv
	  	mods must be able to blacklist items (ex: ace blacklist faks, medikit, toolKit) 

3 - dynamic base assets feature (dynBaseAsset) to spawn the vehicles available to players on server init
		need a list of markers in the map (BV_loc1, BV_loc2)

			BV_heliSmall, BV_heliMedium, BV_heliMedEvac, BV_heliBig, BV_heliAttack, 
			BV_boatSmall, BV_boatAttack, BV_boatBig 
		in map settings assign vehicles markers to base vehicle pools and set a bearing
		pick randomly a vehicle in assigned pool for each markers during server init
		setup the vehicle (cargo)
		append to vehicle monitor stack
