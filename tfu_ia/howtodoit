
HOWTO one mission by map for all mods combo [[+TFAR][+RHS][+ACE]] and with the ability to be BLUFOR or OPFOR
to do that i need :
1 - only place vanilla BLUFOR units in the editor (naked)
		change player side on player init
		
2 - a dynamic Loadout feature (dynLoadout) to change units loadout on player init
	  	need a list of roles (hq, sl, tl, medic, etc...)
	  	foreach roles each mod append things into each slot, so needed slots :
	  		uniform, inUniform, backpack, inBackpack, vest, inVest, helmet, primWeapon, primWeaponItems 
			secWeapon, secWeapItems, handWeapon, handItems, comm, terminal, bino, nv
	  	mods must be able to blacklist items (ex: ace blacklist faks, medikit, toolKit) 

3 - dynamic base assets feature (dynBaseAsset) to spawn the vehicles available to players on server init
		need markers placed in the mission (BV_loc1, BV_loc2)
		in mod settings add vehicles to their pool type, so needed pools : 
			BV_car, BV_apc, BV_tank,  BV_placeCAS, BV_placeAA, BV_planeTransport
			BV_heliSmall, BV_heliMedium, BV_heliMedEvac, BV_heliBig, BV_heliAttack, 
			BV_boatSmall, BV_boatAttack, BV_boatBig 
		in map settings assign vehicles markers to base vehicle pools and set a bearing (can maybe use the bearing of the markers)
		pick randomly a vehicle in assigned pool for each markers during server init
		setup the vehicle (cargo, camo, model)
		append it to vehicle monitor stack
		
4 - dynamic base defence feature (dynBaseDefence) to spawn the AA tank in base
	need markers placed in the mission (BD_loc1, BD_loc2,...)
	in mod settings add vehicles to the pool (BD_pool)
	in map settings assign a bearing to each markers  (BD_markers) (can maybe use the bearing of the markers)
	pick randomly a vehicle in the pool for each markers during server init
	setup the vehicle (unlimited ammo, no fuel, no damage, locked, clear cargo, camo, model)
	setup the gunner (side, skill)

5 - dynamic base atmosphere feature (dynBaseAtmo) to spawn the locked vehicle, npc, object in base
 	need markers placed in the mission (BA_loc1, BA_loc2, ...)
 	for vehicle :
 		in mission editor, place markers, and give it a varname
 		in mod settings add vehicles to the pools (BA_medical, BA_repair, BA_fuel)
		in map settings assign a bearing to each markers (BA_veh)(can maybe use the bearing of the markers) and some roles if needed
		pick randomly a vehicle in the pool for each markers during server init
		setup the vehicle (no damage, no simulation, simple object, camo, model)
	for npc :
		in mission editor, place a BLUFOR (naked) unit, and give it a varname
		in map settings define the list of npcs and assign some roles to each (BA_npc)
		in mod settings assign a loadout to those roles
		setup the npc (side, loadout)
		each feats will be able to add actions to those npc
	for object :
		in mission editor, place the object and give it a varname
		in map settings define the list of object and assign some roles to each (BA_obj)
		roles are :
			arsenal, viewDistance, supplyOfficer, zeusControl
	the features server init will take care of adding the actions to each "things" using that role
	
6 - dynamicly enable/configure ACE modules on server init 
		in description.ext via an include, see @ http://ace3mod.com/wiki/framework/settings-framework.html#loading-up-the-server-config

7 - in server config

	//same as above for Altis and Stratis, just change the class and the template
};


GLOBAL VAR POOLS
----------------
units (those units can wear some restricted gear and/or drive/gun some restricted vehicles)
	U_[pilot, crew, mg, at, marksman, sniper, medic, officer, arti]
allowed vehicle (any unit can drive/gun those vehicles)
	AV_[heli, plane, tank]
restricted gears (only some units can wear those gear)
	RG_[launcher, mg, mRifle, mScope, sRifle, sScope, oScope]
arsenal (available gears)  
	A_[backpacks, items, weapons, ammo]
cargo (available in supplyDrop crates)  
	C_[backpacks, items, weapons, ammo]
rewards (vehicle available as rewards)
	REWARDS	
spawn (units/groups/vehicles/objects we are going to spawn in the missions)  
	S_[radioTower, pilot, crew, +officer, cas, patrolGroups, sniperGroups, aaTank, arti, statics, tank, 
	   apc, car, airPatrol, garrison]
role loadout (default gear provided to player on first spawn)
	RL_[hq, sl, tl, medic, lmg, hmg, assHMG, at, assAT, sniper, marksman, repair, demo, engineer,
		grenadier, rifleman, jtac, pilot, mortar]
base atmosphere
	BA_vehicle => [veh, [actions]]		
	BA_npc => [unit, [actions]]
	BA_object => [obj, [actions]]
base Vehicle
	BV_[car, apc, tank, planeCAS, planeAA, planeTransport, heliSmall, heliMedium, heliMedEvac, heliBig, heliAttack, boatSmall, boatAttack, boatBig, repair, fuel, quad]
next step : multiple base by map
0 - mission param to define which base we use
1 - on server load, removed all other base "placed" assets

2 - place player units in a inaccessible place (closed building anywere)
	when player join:
	 black out screen, 
	 give spawn gear, 
	 teleport to active base role spawn area, 
	 remove black screen

ok, so to compute all the other markers name from the selected base varName
for base protection,		=> %varName%_SZ									=> "SZ" (marker)
for player spawn 			=> %varName%_PS_[inf, crew, hPilot, jPilot]		=> "PS_[inf, crew, hPilot, jPilot]"  (marker)
for repair triggers			=> %varName%_VRT_[land, jet, heli, boat, uav]	=> "VRT_[land, jet, heli, boat, uav]" (marker)
for base vehicle			=> %varName%_BV_[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...]			=> "BV[0,1,2,3,4,...]" (marker)
for fireRange (no mortar)	=> %varName%_FR									=> "FR" (marker)
for fireRange (all gear)	=> %varName%_NOGR								=> "FR_NOGR" (marker)
for base main flag			=> %varName_F									=> FLAG (object)

Yeahhh markers have a bearing :D

also need SZ_RADIUS, FR_RADIUS

Idea for a new feature :
environment  => clearFog 	=> all members 
				setTime	  	=> above pfc 
				setRain		=> aboce recruit
disabled when a curator is assign!


only compute maps/mods on server and broadcast with JIP enabled
			
if i want to be able to change side or base location at run time, i need to:
	have actions : Move base to %baseName1%
				   Move base to %baseName2%	
				   Change side to !%PLAYER_SIDE%
				   Apply Changes (%newBaseName% / %newSide%)	
	be able to reInit everything on server and player side
	%feat%/serverDestroy.sqf
	%feat%/playerDestroy.sqf
	%feat%/headlessDestroy.sqf
 	------------------------------------------------------------
 	client: select "Apply Changes" action
 			[player] remoteExec ["core_fnc_serverReset", 2];
 			
	core_fnc_serverReset: 	if base and side have not changed abord
							lock server (LOCK=true)
							add variable EH on PLAYER_DESTROY to keep track of the player destroy completion
							remoteExec ["core_fnc_playerReset",(allPlayers - entities "healessCliient_F")];
							wait for all players to have finished destroying their features
							remove variable EH
							feats serverDestroy
							enforce base mission param
							enforce side mission param	
							call init.sqf
			
	core_fnc_playerReset:	black screen (BLACKED=true)Some Settings have changed, please wait while the server apply the changes...)
						  	feats playerDestroy
						  	add variable EH on SERVER_INIT to know when server has finished his init
						  	missionNamespace setVariableServer ["PLAYER_DESTOY", player];
						  	wait for server to have finished init
						  	call init.sqf 
	------------------------------------------------------------
	TADA it's reloaded with a new base and/or an other side
