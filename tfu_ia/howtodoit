
HOWTO one mission by map for all mods combo [[+TFAR][+RHS][+ACE]]
to do that i need :
1 - to only place vanilla BLUFOR units in the editor
		change base npc to player side on server init
		change player side on player init
		
2 - a dynamic Loadout feature (dynLoadout) to change units loadout on player init
	  	need a list of roles (hq, sl, tl, medic, etc...)
	  	foreach roles each mod append things into each slot, so needed slots :
	  		uniform, inUniform, backpack, inBackpack, vest, inVest, helmet, launcher, launcherOptic, 
	  		sideArm, sideArmSupressor, sideArmOptic, weapon, weaponSupressor, weaponOptic, weaponHandle, weaponAcc
	  		comm, terminal, bino, nv
	  	mods must be able to blacklist items (ex: ace blacklist faks, medikit, toolKit) 

3 - dynamic base assets feature (dynBaseAsset) to spawn the vehicles available to players on server init
		need markers placed in the mission (BV_loc1, BV_loc2)
		in mod settings add vehicles to their pool type, so needed pools : 
			BV_car, BV_apc, BV_tank,  BV_placeCAS, BV_placeAA, BV_planeTransport
			BV_heliSmall, BV_heliMedium, BV_heliMedEvac, BV_heliBig, BV_heliAttack, 
			BV_boatSmall, BV_boatAttack, BV_boatBig 
		in map settings assign vehicles markers to base vehicle pools and set a bearing (can maybe use the bearing of the markers)
		pick randomly a vehicle in assigned pool for each markers during server init
		setup the vehicle (cargo, camo, model)
		append it to vehicle monitor stack

	need markers placed in the mission (BD_loc1, BB_loc2)
	in mod settings add vehicles to the pool (BD_pool)

5 - dynamic base atmosphere feature (dynBaseAtmo) to spawn the locked vehicle in base
 	need markers placed in the mission (BA_loc1, BB_loc2)
 	in mod settings add vehicles to the pools (BA_medical, BA_repair, BA_fuel)
